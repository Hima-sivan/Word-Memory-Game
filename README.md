# Word-Memory-Game

1. INTRODUCTION
 The Enhanced Memory Test Game is a Pythonbase program designed to improve and evaluate the player's memory skills. The game provides an interactive and engaging way for users to challenge their short-term memory by recalling words from various categories such as fruits, animals, and colors. The game emphasizes user interaction, providing feedback on their performance and encouraging repeated play to enhance memory retention

2.OBJECTIVE
 The main objectives of this project are: 
 1.To create an interactive memory game that allows players to select different word categories.
 
 2.To challenge playerâ€™s memory recall abilities through progressively difficult rounds.

 
 3.To demonstrate the use of Python programming concepts, including conditional statements, loops, and functions.

  4.To provide a simple scoring mechanism that encourages players to improve their performance.

8.CONCLUSION

   The Enhanced Memory Test Game is a successful  implementation of a simple yet effective tool for  improving and testing short-term memory. By providing  an interactive and enjoyable experience, the game

 encourages players to challenge their memory skills and  track their progress over time. This project demonstrates  the effective use of Python programming to create a educational and entertaining application.
